# Q&A (2nd question)

What do you want to learn, or do more of, at work? 

ANSWER:

1. I'm really interested in the possibility of becoming a liaison on social platforms like Hacker News, Reddit and Twitter. 
I just like the idea becoming a spokesperson for the entire Vercel platform. 
2. Next on my list is anything related to finding bugs, analyzing logs, tickets, etc. I enjoy looking for patterns and finding the 
root cause to issues.
3. Additionally, I like the idea of working as a team and becoming a mentor to newer members, helping them get on their feet, become 
independent, and take charge of their future area of expertise.
