# Q&A (3rd question)

Which technical article, guide or lightning talk left the biggest positive impression on you? 
Why? Ideally, this article would not be associated with Vercel or web development, by the way! Please provide links. 

ANSWER:

The first technical guide that came to mind was [LeetGuide's Guide to Algorithms](https://github.com/labuladong/fucking-algorithm/tree/english). 
It breaks down the most common algorithms used in computer science and how and why they works. Often during my own small projects, I would think
that perhaps it'll be easier to solve this problem using recursion, for example, but then I would fall back to the pattern of just using a simple loop.
This guide broke down these simple concepts and explained them in detail.
