# Q&A (3rd question)

Which technical article, guide or lightning talk left the biggest positive impression on you? 
Why? Ideally, this article would not be associated with Vercel or web development, by the way! Please provide links. 

ANSWER:

The first technical guide that came to my mind was [LeetGuide's Guide to Algorithms](https://github.com/labuladong/fucking-algorithm/tree/english). 
It breaks down the most common algorithms used in computer science and the 'how' and 'why' these algorithms work. 

Often, when writing my own projects, I would come across areas where I thought perhaps it'll be easier to solve this problem using recursion, 
for example, but then I would fall back to my old pattern of just using a simple loop, because I still wasn't comfortable enough to switch things around.

This guide broke down all these alogrithmic concepts and explained them in detail.
