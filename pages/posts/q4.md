# Q&A (4th question)

Add a temporary in-app redirect to your project, redirecting /hello-vercel (or any path â€“ but be sure to tell us which!) to https://vercel.com 

ANSWER:

I've modified the `next.config.js` file to redirect [/hello](https://vportfolio.vercel.app/hello) to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
