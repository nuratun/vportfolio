# Q&A (5th question)

A customer writes in to the Helpdesk asking "How do I do a redirect from /hello-vercel to https://vercel.com?" In a couple of paragraphs, how do you respond? 

ANSWER:

Thanks for contacting the support team! I'm going to give you an quick rundown on how to add in a redirect to your project. 

1. First, open your `next.config.js` config file in the root directory of your project
2. You'll notice this file consists of two lines. The first line is the plugin `const withNextra = require('nextra')('nextra-theme-blog', './theme.config.js')`. Leave this line as is. 
3. The second line is the `modules.exports`, which we will modify after creating our redirect.
4. Under the first line, you can add in your redirect, as follows:

`const myRedirect = {
      async redirects() {
        return [
          {
            source: '/home',
            destination: 'https://vercel.com/',
            permanent: true,
          },
        ]
      },
};`

If you want to add in multiple redirects, you can do the following:

`const myRedirect = {
      async redirects() {
        return [
          {
            source: '/home',
            destination: 'https://vercel.com/',
            permanent: true,
          },
          {
            source: '/about',
            destination: '/home',
            permanent: true,
          },
        ]
      },
};`

You will want modify both the 'source' and the 'destination' of each redirect. 

5. Then, include your redirect in your `modules.exports` like this: `module.exports = withNextra( myRedirect );`

Then deploy and run!
