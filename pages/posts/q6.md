# Q&A (6th question)

A customer writes in to the Helpdesk stating "I have a custom domain which I purchased at GoDaddy and 
I want to use it on my project". In a couple of paragraphs, how do you respond? 

ANSWER:

Thank you for contact the Vercel support team! It seems like you bought a domain from GoDaddy and want to redirect your Vercel project to use this domain, instead of the domain you were assigned by us. 

Good news is that we have an entire step-by-step help guide to get you up and running with your own domain. You can find it at this [link](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/custom-domains). 

If you get stuck on any step along the way, don't hesitate to get in touch with me. I'll be happy to help with any questions you may have during this process.
