# Q&A (8th question)

How could we improve or alter this familiarisation exercise? 

ANSWER:

Referring back to my answer in Q7, a step-by-step, interactive guide when a user first deploys a project would be the most helpful step. 
While the user is going through this interactive guide, we can intersperse tutorial videos. Just quick ones, less than a minute, showing the critical 
steps to getting a simple (or more complicated) project up and running. 

Another area that can be altered is giving a new user a questionnaire when they sign up. This questionnaire will be basic, just asking them their level of familiarity with different tools Vercel uses. This way we can tailor how much help a user will need. 

For example, a user who already knows and uses Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc, does not need a tutorial on it. But for someone new to the concept of 
respositories and how they work, the concept may be confusing at first and they will need some extra help.
