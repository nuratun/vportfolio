# Q&A (8th question)

How could we improve or alter this familiarisation exercise? 

ANSWER:

Referring back to my answer in Q7, a step-by-step, interactive guide when a user first deploys a project would be the most helpful step, I believe. 
While the user is going through this interactive guide, we can intersperse tutorial videos. Just quick ones, less than a minute, showing the critical 
steps to getting a simple (or more complicated) project up and running. 

Another area that can be altered is giving a new user a quick questionnaire, basically just asking them regarding their level of familiarity
with different tools. This way we can tailor how much help a user may or may not need. 

For example, a user who already knows and uses Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc, does not need a tutorial on it. But someone more new to the concept of 
respositories and how they work, may be confused at first and need some extra help.
