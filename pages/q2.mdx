# Q&A (2nd question)

What do you want to learn, or do more of, at work? 

ANSWER:

I was really interested in the possibility of becoming an outside liaison on platforms like Hacker News, Reddit and Twitter. 
Basically, just becoming a spokesperson for the Vercel platform. 

Also, anything related to finding bugs, analyzing logs and tickets, finding patterns and finding the root cause to a problem are
all areas of immense interest to me. 

Additionally, I like the idea of working as a team and becoming a mentor to newer members and helping them get on their feet, become 
independent, and take charge of their area of expertise.
